My subject today is how to have a better work life.

Jackie's perception of the situation was that everyone will go through the midlife crisis. So the priority is to broaden your career pathway.

He felt that his English had been inadequate to prepare him for the demands of the job. The implicit meaning is that without the new skill, he may lose his job soon.

Although Jackie has set out an ambitious plan for the next 5 months to pass the BEC Higher, it would be unrealistic if he doesn't take a lot of time to do it.

He is learning English for dual reasons, to have a better salary and know more about a foreign country. Technology has evolved to such an extent that we need to have a global vision.

Jackie hopes that after many years of working as an employee, he can pursue a portfolio career.
